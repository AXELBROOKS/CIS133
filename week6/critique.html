    <h1>Critique of Pacific Trails Resort Website</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>With regard to good design practices, the first thing that I notice is that there is a consistent design among the various pages. The header, navigation, and footer lend to this by beign consistent and clean on each page. The second thing I notice is that there is a good balance of content and white space on each page. There is enough content on each page without being overwhelming. The third thing I noticed is that the website is fully functional on mobile devices. I determined this by using the "Mobile Simulator- responsive testing" extension in Google Chrome. </li><br>

        <li>With regard to bad or poor design practices, the first thing I notice is that gray text on white bacground may pose visibility problems for some people due to the lower contrast (scoring around a 1.69 on webAIM's contrast checker and failing all the tests). The second thing I noticed was that color alone is used to indicate meaning. Without playing with the website a little bit, I wouldn't know that "Home", "Yurts", "Activities", and "Reservations" were links. Finally, the third thing I noticed was that there were two or three different fonts used for the web pages. While my computer had the fonts installed, some users might not and instead receive only a serif or sans-serif font.</li><br>

        <li>Overall the website mostly follows good design practices. About the only things I could suggest to improve the site are to include a little bit more interactivity to appeal to all audiences, improve the contrast of the sub-text, somehow display the links in a more understandable way, and to limit font usage. For example, the hero picture could be substituted by a "hero slideshow" of photos, the sub-text could be colored dark gray, black, or dark blue, the links could be underlined or have boxes around them, and the font could be limited to one style. These are just my personal preferences though and might not appeal to all audiences, especially since I feel this website's target audience is everyone. Note there was also a spelling error of the word structures on the "Yurts" page which could hinder the credibility of the website.</li><br>
