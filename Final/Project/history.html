        <h1 id="historyTitle"> A Brief History of Figure Skating</h1>

        <p id="history1">The history of figure skating can be traced back to 3000 BC, when people in Scandinavia and Russia used
            animal bones as makeshift skates to travel across frozen lakes and rivers. These early skates lacked edges,
            so skaters relied on poles for propulsion. By the 14th century, the Dutch had developed skates with
            sharpened steel blades, allowing for greater speed and control.

        <p id="history2">
            Figure skating as a recreational activity emerged in the 18th century, and the first organized figure
            skating club was formed in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the 1740s. In 1772, Englishman Robert Jones published the
            first instructional book on figure skating, which helped to popularize the sport. By the late 1800s, figure
            skating competitions were held, and skaters were judged on the precision of their figures (patterns traced
            on the ice).
        </p>
        <p id="history3">
            Figure skating made its Olympic debut in 1908 at the Summer Olympics (it wasn't until 1924 that the Winter
            Olympics were established). Initially, the sport was dominated by men, but women's figure skating began to
            gain popularity in the early 20th century. The first Winter Olympic gold medal in women's figure skating was
            won by Norway's Sonja Henie in 1928.

        <p id="history4">
            Today, figure skating is a popular sport enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a demanding
            sport that requires a high level of athleticism, artistry, and technical skill. Figure skating is also a
            popular spectator sport, and the Winter Olympics figure skating competition is one of the most watched
            events of the Games.
