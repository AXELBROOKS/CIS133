    <h1>Web Hosting Companies</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, the three web hosting companies I reviewed were HostPapa, Bluehost, and HostGator. These
        three were the top three hostingreview.com reviewed. Here is what I found:</p>

    <table id="Review" border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th id="Link">Company Link</th>
                <th id="Web_Allowed"># of Websites Allowed</th>
                <th id="SSD_Storage">SSD Storage</th>
                <th id="Domain">Domain Registration</th>
                <th id="PHP">PHP and mySQL Support</th>
                <th id="Ecom">E-Commerce platform</th>
                <th id="Month">Total Cost</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td id="Link"><a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/">www.hostpapa.com</a>
                <td id="Web_Allowed">1 website</td>
                <td id="SSD_Storage">100GB</td>
                <td id="Domain">Free domain registration</td>
                <td id="PHP">Yes</td>
                <td id="Ecom">LoadedCommerce</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td id="Link"><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">www.bluehost.com</a>
                <td id="Web_Allowed">1 website</td>
                <td id="SSD_Storage">40GB</td>
                <td id="Domain">Free domain registration</td>
                <td id="PHP">Yes</td>
                <td id="Ecom">WooCommerce/ YITH</td>
                <td id="Month">$6.75/month</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td id="Link"><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">www.hostgator.com</a>
                <td id="Web_Allowed">1 website</td>
                <td id="SSD_Storage">10GB</td>
                <td id="Domain">Free domain registration</td>
                <td id="PHP">Yes</td>
                <td id="Ecom">Magento/ Prestashop/ Zencart</td>
                <td id="Month">$3.75/month</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        
        <tfoot>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="7">NOTE: Both Bluehost and HostGator offer free domain registration for the first year with the following years having a cost that varies depending on the TLD.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="7">NOTE: All of these websites have an E-Commerce package that includes web hosting therefore it is impossible to seperate the cost into the three categories of the instructions.</th>
            </tr>
        </tfoot>
    </table>

    <p>Based off the research I conducted, if I had to pick one of these three web hosting sites, I would probably pick HostPapa. It offers the most storage, free domain registration and offers PHP and mySQL support as well as being a reasonable cost.</p>
