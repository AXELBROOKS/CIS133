        <h1>How to Pick a Good Pet</h1>
        <p>There are a few things to consider when deciding on getting a pet. The first thing to consider is how much space you have. Some pets take up more space than others. For example, dogs require more space to roam abou whereas cats are content to sit curled up somewhere. Another thing to consider is how much responsibility it will be and your age. An older owner might want a less demanding pet than a younger owner. That's not to say that an older owner can't have an energetic pet, but it is a consideration that should be made.</p>
        <p>An additional consideration should be made as to the age of the pet. While a lot of people prefer puppies and kittens, the younger the pet the more work it will be to care for it. You should also meet the pet of your choice before you purchase them. This way you get to know the temperment of the animal you are about to buy. </p>
