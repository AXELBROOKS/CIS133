        <h1>How to Pick a Good Pet</h1>
        <p>There are two final considerations that should be made when picking a pet. The first is the life span of the pet. Do you want something with a shorter lifespan or with a longer life span? According to onehealth.org, cats live an average of fifteen years while dogs live an average of twelve years. Do you want to and, can you both physically and financially, afford to have a pet for that long?</p>
        <p>The final thing to consider is the financial aspect. According to the ASPCA, it can cost upwards of $1,000 a year to care for a cat and $3,000 a year to care for a dog. Are you willing and able to make such commitments? Remember, a smaller pet will likely cost less money to take care of and may not have the same requirements as a cat or dog. In the end, picking a good pet involves realizing what commitments and how long of a commitment you are willing to make.Once you make those descisions, it can be very rewarding to have a furry friend by your side.</p>
